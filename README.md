# Anywhere Fitness 🏋️ 

Anywhere fitness is a solution for fitness instructors and independent fitness businesses that offer classes and appointments, 
as well as help to ease the unnecessary logistics that cut into training time, like taking attendance or scheduling future training sessions. 

With Anywhere Fitness you are able to: 

 ✔️ As an instructor: create a class, take attendance, maintain a record of your members and ongoing classes. 

 ✔️ As a client: schedule a class based on type, time, duration, level, and location, and even reschedule or cancel upcoming appointments. 

Anywhere fitness simplifies client scheduling, allows you or your business to easily take on more clients, and is everything you need to efficiently run and manage your gym.
